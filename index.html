	<h2>Linkgannon's Software Projects</h2>
	<b>I am currently in the process of migrating and hosting all of my projects on this site. I currently only have links for downloading the Gen Con Event Planner and the Twitch Vid Converter. The rest should be coming in the very near future.</b>

		<b><a href="">GW2 Commerce Assistant</a></b><br/>
		This software constantly monitors all items on the trading post in Guild Wars 2, uses an advanced scoring algorithm (or your own custom algorithm) for determing a "flippability" score, then uses that score to tell you which items are the most profitable to flip. For this project, I worked with professional economists to determine the necessary parameter and create a default flippability algorithm based on the GW2 markets at that time.<br/><br/>

		<b><a href="">GW2 Item Checker</a></b><br/>

		<b>Protodeck Card Studio - Coming Soon</b> (like, Hollow Knight: Silksong soon)<br/>
